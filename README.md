Round one
Prochazka v Pereira

A much slower start than what we saw in the co-main.

Both fighters are looking to find their range with kicks initially and Pereira catches Prochazka with a lovely calf kick - sending him down to the canvas.

Actually, he follows with a couple more and Prochazka is looking unsteady on his feet.
Serhiy Popko, head of the administration, said Ukraine's air defence systems hit around 10 drones in Kyiv and its outskirts.

No "critical damage" or casualties have been reported, he said.

Meanwhile, Russian authorities said a Ukrainian drone heading for Moscow was shot down on Saturday.

The defence ministry said the un-crewed aircraft (UAVs) was intercepted over the Bogorodsky District on the north-eastern outskirts of the capital.

Moscow mayor Sergei Sobyanin said there was no damage or casualties.

Sunday's air raids against Ukrainian targets follow a wave of attacks the night before, with Kyiv saying it had shot down 29 out of 38 Iranian-made Shahed drones launched by Russia.

The BBC is unable to independently verify exactly how many drones were launched and destroyed.

On Saturday, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky praised his air force for shooting down the UAVs - the highest number reported to have been launched by Russia in more than six weeks.

In his nightly address, Mr Zelensky said: "Your accuracy, guys, is literally life for Ukraine" - but he warned that as winter approaches Russia would try to make its attacks more powerful.

He said Russia could be stockpiling missiles for a winter assault on Ukraine's energy infrastructure.

Friday night's drone strikes caused power cuts in more than 400 towns and villages across Ukraine and also damaged an oil depot in Odesa in the south - leaving more than 1,500 residents without power.

Ukraine said nearly 21,000 people in the Donetsk region have no electricity, and 63 settlements are cut off in the Zaporizhzhia region.
