Round one
Prochazka v Pereira

A much slower start than what we saw in the co-main.

Both fighters are looking to find their range with kicks initially and Pereira catches Prochazka with a lovely calf kick - sending him down to the canvas.

Actually, he follows with a couple more and Prochazka is looking unsteady on his feet.
